JavaScript
----------
* Use the latest stable JavaScript syntax with a transpiler, such as [babel].
* Include a `to_param` or `href` attribute when serializing ActiveRecord models,
  and use that when constructing URLs client side, rather than the ID.

[babel]: http://babeljs.io/

HTML
----

* Don't use a reset button for forms.
* Prefer cancel links to cancel buttons.
* Use `<button>` tags over `<a>` tags for actions.

CSS
---

* Use Sass.
* Use [Autoprefixer][autoprefixer] to generate vendor prefixes based on the
  project-specific browser support that is needed.

[autoprefixer]: https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer

Sass
----

* Prefer `overflow: auto` to `overflow: scroll`, because `scroll` will always
  display scrollbars outside of OS X, even when content fits in the container.
* Use `image-url` and `font-url`, not `url`, so the asset pipeline will re-write
  the correct paths to assets.
* Prefer mixins to `@extend`.

Browsers
--------

* Avoid supporting versions of Internet Explorer before IE10.
