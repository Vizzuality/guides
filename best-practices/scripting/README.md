Shell
-----

* Don't parse the output of `ls`. See [here][parsingls] for details and
  alternatives.
* Don't use `cat` to provide a file on `stdin` to a process that accepts
  file arguments itself.
* Don't use `echo` with options, escapes, or variables (use `printf` for those
  cases).
* Don't use a `/bin/sh` [shebang][] unless you plan to test and run your
  script on at least: Actual Sh, Dash in POSIX-compatible mode (as it
  will be run on Debian), and Bash in POSIX-compatible mode (as it will
  be run on OSX).
* Don't use any non-POSIX [features][bashisms] when using a `/bin/sh`
  [shebang][].
* If calling `cd`, have code to handle a failure to change directories.
* If calling `rm` with a variable, ensure the variable is not empty.
* Prefer "$@" over "$\*" unless you know exactly what you're doing.
* Prefer `awk '/re/ { ... }'` to `grep re | awk '{ ... }'`.
* Prefer `find -exec {} +` to `find -print0 | xargs -0`.
* Prefer `for` loops over `while read` loops.
* Prefer `grep -c` to `grep | wc -l`.
* Prefer `mktemp` over using `$$` to "uniquely" name a temporary file.
* Prefer `sed '/re/!d; s//.../'` to `grep re | sed 's/re/.../'`.
* Prefer `sed 'cmd; cmd'` to `sed -e 'cmd' -e 'cmd'`.
* Prefer checking exit statuses over output in `if` statements (`if grep
  -q ...; `, not `if [ -n "$(grep ...)" ];`).
* Prefer reading environment variables over process output (`$TTY` not
  `$(tty)`, `$PWD` not `$(pwd)`, etc).
* Use `$( ... )`, not backticks for capturing command output.
* Use `$(( ... ))`, not `expr` for executing arithmetic expressions.
* Use `1` and `0`, not `true` and `false` to represent boolean
  variables.
* Use `find -print0 | xargs -0`, not `find | xargs`.
* Use quotes around every `"$variable"` and `"$( ... )"` expression
  unless you want them to be word-split and/or interpreted as globs.
* Use the `local` keyword with function-scoped variables.
* Identify common problems with [shellcheck][].

Bash

In addition to Shell best practices,

* Prefer `${var,,}` and `${var^^}` over `tr` for changing case.
* Prefer `${var//from/to}` over `sed` for simple string replacements.
* Prefer `[[` over `test` or `[`.
* Prefer process substitution over a pipe in `while read` loops.
* Use `((` or `let`, not `$((` when you don't need the result
